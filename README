NAME
    RT-Extension-Turbo - Experimental extension using Turbo

DESCRIPTION
    An experimental extension using Turbo <https://turbo.hotwired.dev/> with
    RT.

RT VERSION
    Works with RT 5.

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    Patch RT
        If you are running on RT 5.0.3 or earlier, apply the included patch:

            patch -p1 -d /opt/rt5 < patches/0001-Add-callback-to-modify-content-presented-via-TitleBo.patch

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        Add this line:

            Plugin('RT::Extension::Turbo');

    Clear your mason cache
            rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj

    Restart your webserver

ToDo
    *   Make it a user-level and global config option to switch homepages

    *   Add a timer at debug level in logs per component

    *   Fix issue with reloading dropdowns on refresh

    *   Get forms working (Quickcreate)

    *   Add auto-refresh feature per portlet

    *   Update RT to read the "collapsed" cookie setting and load titlebox
        closed if the titlebox has been hidden. Currently we load open, then
        quickly close it. This allows lazy load to work properly.
